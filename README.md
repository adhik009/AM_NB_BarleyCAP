# AM_NB_BarleyCAP
Codes used to run association mapping for net blotch resistance in Barley CAP data as a part of my MS thesis research.

This is a sample code which was used to run GWAS or AM analysis for combined dataset using rrBLUP package.
The folder also includes code for a summary heatmap generated using the final results.
